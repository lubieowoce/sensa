# 🔵 Sensa

Work with EEG signals comfortably.



## Installation
### Windows

*(64-bit only for now)*

Sensa uses `pipenv` for installation, so you'll need python and pip installed. pipenv will install Sensa's own python and packages into an isolated pipenv environment, so it won't interfere with your system-wide python installation.

First, install pipenv:
```
> pip install pipenv
```
Then, clone/download sensa.
Install the dependencies:
```
> cd sensa
> pipenv install
```
Done! 👍
(hopefully) 


### Unix-based systems

Not tested, but should work fine!


## Run
```
> pipenv run python app.py
```

## Shell
```
> pipenv run python
```
